## Grouping example

- Layout_Groups.save: layout file that can be loaded in PlateEditor.
- Definition_Groups.txt: text file containing the definition for 2 plates, for the range "Range" defined in the layout. The definition should be mapped to the "Definition" column, only column present in the file.
- Results_Groups.xlsx: excel file containing the results for 2 plates. The file can be mapped with a Well ID ("Well") and Plate ID ("Plate"). The "Data" column should be imported as a numeric type.
- Auto-pair the result and definition files using the Index.

Use the "Grouped Analysis" tool to aggregate the values using multiple dimensions. The Areas, Concentrations and Range data can be added as rows and columns, both level 1 and 2.
Try out different configurations to explore the effects on the aggregation.

Note: the data in the result file were artificially created to simplify the validity of the aggregation process
