## DRC3 example

- Layout.save: layout file that can be loaded in PlateEditor.
- Definition.txt: text file containing the definition for 3 plates, for the range "compounds" defined in the layout. The definition should be mapped to the "Name" column, only column present in the file.
- Result.xlsx: excel file containing the results for each 3 plates. The file can be mapped with a Well ID ("Well") and Plate ID ("Plate"). The "Data" column should be imported as a numeric type.

Pairing can be done using the auto-pairing option (pair by index).
Use the "Grouped Analysis" tool to aggregate the values for each compound. The concentration data can be added as rows and the range "compounds" added as columns.

Note: the data in the result file were selected from real-world experiments
