## Screening example

- Layout.save: layout file that can be loaded in PlateEditor.
- Definition.csv: text file containing the definition for the range "cpds" defined in the layout. The file can be mapped with a Well ID ("Well") and a Plate ID ("Plate ID"). The definition should be mapped to the "Cpd ID" column.
- Result.xlsx: excel file containing the results for all plates. The file can be mapped with a Well ID ("Well") and a Plate ID ("Plate ID"). The "RFU" column should be imported as a numeric type.

Pairing can be done using the auto-pairing option (pair by name).
Use the "Controls" tool to visualize the controls for each plate.
Use the "Hits" tool to select hits above a given threshold.

Note: the data in the result file are results from real-world experiments
